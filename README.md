# IndaPlus22/vprytz-sorting

Visualize sorting algorithms, see [task-11](https://github.com/IndaPlus22/AssignmentInstructions-BlueNote/tree/main/task-11).

## Running locally

Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) (also see [Getting Started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started)).

Clone the project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:IndaPlus22/vprytz-sorting.git
```

Assuming `love` is in your path, run:

```bash
love .
```

Sorting algorithms are implemented in `sorting.lua`.

## Implemented algorithms

- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Bubble sort

## Note about testing

There are testing libraries for LUA but most of them look outdated. There are also no tests for LÖVE.
